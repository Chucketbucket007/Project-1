Adding more skills to core character classes. Currently, Only the Spellsword class is playable, and there are a few levels in development. Currently running ebugs on current material before progressing to next update, which will include a few more completed quests, work on the Guncaster class, and more debug runs. This is naturally goig to take time to complete, but expect regular updates.
